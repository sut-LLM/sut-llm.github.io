# Large Language Models Course

Welcome to the Large Language Models course at Sharif University of Technology! This course delves into the fascinating world of large language models, a pivotal area of artificial intelligence that has transformed the field of natural language processing (NLP). Over the semester, we will explore the theoretical foundations and practical applications of these cutting-edge models.

In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI, large language models have emerged as powerful tools for understanding, generating, and manipulating human language. We will start by tracing the historical development of language models, from rule-based systems to statistical models, and finally to the modern era of deep learning-based models. These large language models, such as GPT-3 and its successors, have become instrumental in various NLP tasks, including text generation, sentiment analysis, question answering, and more.

Throughout the course, we will delve into the core components of large language models, including their architecture, training techniques, and fine-tuning strategies. We'll also address important ethical considerations, such as bias mitigation and fairness, which are crucial in the development and deployment of these models. Our aim is not only to equip you with the technical skills to work with large language models but also to foster a deep understanding of the responsible use of AI technologies.

By the end of the semester, you'll have gained the knowledge and hands-on experience needed to apply large language models to real-world problems. Whether you aspire to build intelligent chatbots, improve language translation systems, or explore the ethical implications of AI, this course will provide you with a solid foundation to excel in the dynamic and exciting field of large language models.

Join us on this journey to unlock the potential of large language models and shape the future of AI and NLP. Get ready to explore, innovate, and make a positive impact on the world of artificial intelligence!
